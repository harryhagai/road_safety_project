# Confidential Web Portal for Road Safety Reporting with Geospatial Mapping

This project is a secure web-based portal designed to help citizens and commuters report road safety incidents and traffic violations anonymously. It also gives road officers and transport authorities a protected dashboard for managing reports, reviewing evidence, and analyzing road safety hotspots using location data.
